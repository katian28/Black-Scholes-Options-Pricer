# 🧮 Black-Scholes Options Pricer

A simple and elegant Jupyter Notebook that implements the Black-Scholes model for pricing European call and put options. Built with Python and Matplotlib, this project offers a hands-on introduction to quantitative finance and option pricing theory.

## 📌 Overview

The Black-Scholes model is a cornerstone of financial mathematics, used by traders and analysts to determine the fair price of European options. This notebook walks through:

- The derivation and implementation of the Black-Scholes formula.
- Interactive visualizations of how option prices change with stock prices.
- Sensitivity analysis using Delta, one of the fundamental "Greeks".
- (Optional) A preview of how to fetch real market data with `yfinance`.
